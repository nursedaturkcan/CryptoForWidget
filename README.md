Today, I want to share the work I’ve done on a new feature I developed using React Native and WidgetKit! 😎
🔹 Project: I’ve developed an app that allows users to view their favorite cryptocurrencies directly on iOS widgets.
🔹 Goal: Users can quickly view data like their favorite coins' prices and percentage changes through the widget. This way, they can get a quick glance at the latest market movements without having to open the main app. 🚀
Additionally, in this project, I used React Native as the main platform and seamlessly integrated the iOS widget development process. This once again proves how powerful React Native is! 🌐 Long live React Native Bridge! ✨

How do you think iOS widgets can transform the mobile app experience? 🤔👇
